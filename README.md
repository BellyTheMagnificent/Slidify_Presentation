### Tips
Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line).

Rstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.   

You can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/  and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.
